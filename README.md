# MacMillan_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:
My project will take in data from the user to create an organized list of grocery items. There will be a struct called listItem which includes price, amount, item name, and category, and a class called list. All the items will be added to a double-linked list. The user will be prompted for their budjet upon running the program and once enough items have been added that they are over the budjet, they will be notified. There will be methods for adding items, deleting items, comparing prices, applying a coupon (adds to budjet), deleting whole list, deleting everything within a category, add/edit name of list, check remaining budjet, edit budget, and display list.

How to Run:
Clone the url using git clone "url", then in the terminal naviagate to the repository and enter g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp List.cpp List.h. No command line arguments are needed. Once the program opens, you will be prompted for your budget and whatever else you would like to use the program for.
